Multi-Stage Docker Builds 
Multi-stage builds in Docker help create smaller, optimized images by using multiple stages in a single Dockerfile.
This is especially useful for building applications where you need build tools in one stage but donâ€™t want them in the final image.

Here used scratch to reduce the image size. Firt stage in build using ubuntu and go compiles the application
second stage in run , runs it in minimalistic container.
