Why terraform? API as a code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Define infrastructure using code for automation and version control.

Declarative Syntax

You describe the desired state, and Terraform figures out the steps.

Cloud-Agnostic

Supports AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, VMware, etc.

Execution Planning

terraform plan shows exactly what will change before applying it.

State Management

Tracks the real-world state of infrastructure for accurate updates.

Idempotency

Running the same code multiple times results in the same infrastructure.

Modularity

Use reusable modules for cleaner, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

Multi-Cloud Support

Manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers from one tool.

Extensible Ecosystem

Large collection of providers and community-maintained modules.

Team Collaboration

Remote backends and state locking allow safe, shared use in teams.
