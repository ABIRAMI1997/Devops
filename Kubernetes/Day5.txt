Load balancing and networking

SVC - service

Service discovery
labels and selectors

Networking
1. cluster IP -- inside the k8s - discovery and load balancing
2. Nodeport - inside organisation - worker node ip address - node ip address - vpc nodes
3. Load balancer - external world

Traffic flow usin gkubeshark
1. Create docker image
2. create deployment file using the image, use selector and label
3. Kubectl get deploy


Cluster IP:
Login using ssh and use crul to open the app

Node Port:
Inside spec in the nodeport
Target poer where the port is running
kubectl get svc
minikube ip
image name should be same as selector name (Service discovery)
Load balancing and packet travel from src ip , to minikube ip to service ip in round robin fashion
